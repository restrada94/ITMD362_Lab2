## ITMD 362, Lab 2: Form Semantics and Normalized Styles

In the `index.html` file in this directory, create a form that asks for
a userâ€™s email address, phone number, and date of birth. There should also be a submit button.

Be sure to:

* Use the best HTML `<input>` types
* Use additional HTML `<input>` attributes to maximize user exprience
* Use semantically associated `<label>` tags

Then, in the `screen.css` file, do the following:

* Open with Eric Meyer reset
* Include a set of normalization styles for your forms (such as the Form area of Normalize.css)
* Create a second CSS file to stylalize the form between a scroll friendly mobile first version, and a sectioned desktop version. 

As with all labs, be sure that you are doing multiple, granular/atomic commits as you
complete your work.

* Finally, post a link to your Github repository and live link for this lab to your Basecamp file.
